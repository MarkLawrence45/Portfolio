               <h3> May 2020 – September 2020:</h3>
               Parts sales advisor, MSL service centre, North circular road, Dublin – I worked as parts advisor for MSL, taking in deliveries of car parts that included Mercedes, Mazda, Volkswagen and Skoda from morning until afternoon.
               during that time I’d check in the parts and make sure they were ours and then separate them into two piles, one for the garage and the other was for sales advisors, then took phone calls from customers and garages enquiring about parts, 
               ordered parts In, charged customers, gave the parts out and counted stock.<br>
               <br>

               check when parts will be coming in etc. <br> A lot of my time is spent on the computer, I frequantly used Microsoft excel, word, outlook and the software ADP.
